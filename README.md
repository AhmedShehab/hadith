#Improvements Suggestions:

###Personalized Learning Paths:
Introduce personalized learning journeys for users to deepen their Islamic knowledge.
Users can select a target achievement, such as memorizing the Quran, and the app will provide a program to help them achieve it within a specific timeframe, like 30 days.
You can also gamify the process by rewarding users with achievements along the way

### Creating Quiz Streaks:
Introduce daily quiz streaks that are distributed to each user. Along the way, users can earn achievements, such as a 7-day streak badge, as their knowledge accumulates. Additionally, users have the option to select the topic of the quizzes if they wish to focus on a specific subject.
### Kids Mode:
Develop a feature specifically designed for children that facilitates the comprehension of Islamic concepts in an engaging and interactive manner.
Within this application, incorporate a narrative mode that narrates the stories of Prophets and Sahaba in a simplified and child-friendly language.
Additionally, incorporate lessons on “Adab al Islam,” which encompass the essential principles of Islamic etiquette and behavior appropriate for their age group.
Ultimately, this application aims to enhance children’s engagement with Islam by providing them with an accessible and interactive platform to learn the fundamental aspects of the religion that are relevant to their developmental stage.
